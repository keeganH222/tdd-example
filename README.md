# Udacity Blog Testing

A Udacity based project to test our knowledge of code testing development. 

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## How to edit the tests

1. Download the repo with ```git clone https://github.com/keeganH222/tdd-example``` into file with command line

1. Open up jasmine/spec file and open up feedreaderSpec.js

1. Edit the test code to you're liking!
